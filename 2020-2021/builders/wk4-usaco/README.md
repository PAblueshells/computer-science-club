# Intro to USACO - Resources

Past problems can be found listed by contest and division on the [USACO website](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=contests). If you make an account on the [homepage](http://usaco.org/), you can enter 'analysis mode' and upload files to be tested for accuracy. Happy coding!

The solution to Cow Gymnastics, one problem we discussed, is included in `cow_gym.py`.
